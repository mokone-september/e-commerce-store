## 🧭 Overview

This e-commerce project blends my interest in custom mechanical keyboards with my goal of mastering modern frontend technologies. Built with Vue.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, this store delivers a smooth shopping experience with a minimalist UI and key features such as:

- Dynamic product pages and categories

- A responsive layout for mobile and desktop

- Persistent shopping cart using local storage

- SEO-friendly metadata and fast-loading content

## 🗻 The Challenge

I wanted to create a professional-grade store while learning:

- Routing and page generation using Vue Router

- Centralized state with Pinia and VueUse

- Typed development with TypeScript

- E2E testing with Cypress

- SEO and page performance with modern tools

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Vue 3 – Frontend Framework

- Vue Router – SPA Navigation

- Pinia + VueUse – State Management

- TypeScript – Static Typing

- TailwindCSS – Utility-first Styling

- Vite – Fast Build Tooling

- Cypress – Testing Suite

- Unhead – Document Head Management

- ESLint + Prettier – Code Quality

- HTML5 + WebP – Semantic Structure & Optimized Images

## 💡 What I Learned
- Vue Router
- Dynamic routing with params and props

- Scroll position handling and lazy-loading routes

- 404 route handling and back-navigation behavior

- State Management (Pinia + VueUse)
- Reactive cart and form data storage

- Reload-persistent state using useStorage

- Form validation using centralized logic

- TypeScript
- Stronger prop typing and function contracts

- Defined interfaces for product data

- Safer development and better autocompletion

- TailwindCSS
- Responsive design using flex/grid and viewport units

- Conditional styling based on data

- Cart overlay and layered UI interactions

✅ Testing Strategy
- Cypress E2E: Happy/unhappy path testing

- Component Tests: Unit-level confidence in UI elements

- Integration Tests: Basic test coverage for workflows

- Viewport Tests: Ensuring mobile/tablet/desktop responsiveness

📈 SEO & Optimization
- Dynamic meta tags via Unhead

- Open Graph support for sharing

- HTML semantics for better crawling

- WebP image optimization & lazy loading

- Lighthouse for performance tuning

## 🗂️ Project Structure & Code Quality
- Directory organization for scalability

- ESLint for code consistency

- Tailwind Prettier plugin for class ordering

- Git-based version control and commit discipline

## 🚀 Future Development
- I'm planning to refactor and expand this app by:

- Rebuilding with Nuxt 3 for SSR, content management, and better SEO

- Adding a backend with Express or Django for:

- Authentication (login, sign-up, account cart)

- Admin panel for CRUD product management

- Purchase analytics and dashboards

- Integrating Stripe or PayPal for real payment workflows

- Improving test coverage and adding PWA features
